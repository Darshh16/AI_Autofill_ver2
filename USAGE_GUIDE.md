## 🔧 **When DO You Need the Terminal?**

### **Only if you want to modify the code:**

1. **Make changes** to the code files
2. **Run** `npm run build` to rebuild
3. **Reload** the extension:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click the refresh icon ↻ on the extension card

## 📝 **Quick Commands Reference:**

```bash
# Development mode (hot reload, for coding)
npm run dev

# Production build (one-time, for daily use)
npm run build
```

## 🎉 **You're All Set!**

The extension is now:

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

1. **Keep the `dist` folder** - Chrome loads the extension from here
2. **Don't delete the project** - The extension needs these files
3. **To update**: Run `npm run build` again and reload the extension
4. **To uninstall**: Remove it from `chrome://extensions/`
